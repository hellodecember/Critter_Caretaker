# Critter Caretaker
 A game where you take care of a critter.

When initialized, the menu will display 3 options you can take with your critter. The first is to obtain its current status (happy, okay, frustrated, or mad). The second option is to feed your critter and the third is to play with your critter. As you play the critter's status will change; the objective is to keep the critter happy.
